# Crossout-Grid
A small mathematical game where it was used design pattern MVC and Unity Events

## Make a simple game where:
* the game generates a grid 4x4 with values between 1 and 11.
* the player can choose which cells to pick to collect 21 points.
* Ex: picking 3 cells with 3, 7, and 11 gives the player 21 points.
* those cells should work as toggles (single click selects a given cell and a second click deselects the cell)
* if the player exceeds 21 points (selects cells worth more than 21 points) he loses the value of selected cells divided by 2.
* Ex: a player picks cells with the following numbers 4, 6, 3, and 10 which gives the sum of 23, the game will divide that value by 2 which equals 11 (weâ€™re using int values here). This value (11) will be subtracted from the player's score.
the game finishes when the player scores 60 points.
* The whole project can be made using only UI components.
